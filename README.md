## About
We created this project so we can automatically check if someone submitted their dance video on time before practice more easily. We post our vidoes to a private Facebook group, so we will scrape the page and get their username and time of posting, and put it onto a Google Sheets in an easy to read manner so we can keep track of who submitted and who didn't. We'll be implementing the critical parts of this in Python, and using the React framework if we decide to develop a web UI.

This is just a fun side project and hope to also learn along the way :)

## Setup
We aren't doing too much, but we need to install a few packages.
```sh
pip install facebook-scraper
```
